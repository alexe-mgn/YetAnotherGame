# Little arcade game based on self-made game engine
# using pygame and pymunk.
# Engine (https://github.com/alexe-mgn/PyGameEngine) is managed as separate repository
# and git submodule of this one.
# Engine submodule files are to be fetched using "git submodule update --init" or other appropriate way
# before usage of the game itself.
# Required libraries are listed in requirements.txt,
# usage of specified versions might be critical.
# Game can launched with run_default.py or game_main.py
# Pyinstaller spec run_default.spec may be used for deployment,
# but is yet to be simplified by usage of built-in pyinstaller mechanics.
